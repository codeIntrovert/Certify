# Learning React.js and TypeScript - Project 1

Welcome to the **Learning React.js and TypeScript** repository! This repository is dedicated to the first project of your journey to master React.js and TypeScript. In this project, you will build a simple web application to practice and demonstrate your newfound skills.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a basic to-do list application using React.js and TypeScript. This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of React.js and how to incorporate TypeScript into your web development workflow.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Organize tasks into categories.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
